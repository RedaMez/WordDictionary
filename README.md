## About The Project

[![](./res/worddictionary-screenshot.png)](res/worddictionary-screenshot.png)

Word Dictionary is a mobile application designed to facilitate language learning
by allowing users to save words from translation websites. The app serves as a 
personalized dictionary, enabling users to curate a collection of words they want to learn.
Here's how the app works:
- Word Collection:
    Users can input words manually or, more conveniently, save them directly from translation
    websites. The app seamlessly integrates with popular translation sites to extract and store
    selected words. 
- Notification System :
    The app employs a notification system to prompt users with a selection of saved words at scheduled
    intervals. These notifications serve as gentle reminders for users to focus on learning a few
    words at a time.
